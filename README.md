## About

This project focuses on predicting flat prices in Indian cities, utilizing a dataset comprising entries with 9 key factors, including construction status, regulatory approvals (RERA), room count (BHK_NO.), square footage (SQUARE_FT), and location details (ADDRESS, LONGITUDE, LATITUDE). The comprehensive analysis aims to unveil correlations, patterns, and insights within the real estate landscape, crucial for understanding the impact of these elements on flat prices. By leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms, the project seeks to construct a robust predictive model, providing a valuable tool for estimating flat prices and contributing insights into housing market dynamics for informed decision-making by stakeholders in the real estate sector.

## Usage

There are three notebooks in this project. Divyesh_Lagisetty_code0.ipynb file is used for preprocessing and producing data(with PCA and without PCA for dimensionality reduction on the data). Divyesh_Lagisetty_code1.ipynb and Divyesh_Lagisetty_code2.ipynb are used for employing different regression on these preprocessed data and results that were obtained by implementing these methods after hyperparameter tuning on test data were uploaded in .npy files.
