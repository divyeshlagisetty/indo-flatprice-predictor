## About

This project focuses on predicting flat prices in Indian cities, utilizing a dataset comprising entries with 9 key factors, including construction status, regulatory approvals (RERA), room count (BHK_NO.), square footage (SQUARE_FT), and location details (ADDRESS, LONGITUDE, LATITUDE). The comprehensive analysis aims to unveil correlations, patterns, and insights within the real estate landscape, crucial for understanding the impact of these elements on flat prices. By leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms, the project seeks to construct a robust predictive model, providing a valuable tool for estimating flat prices and contributing insights into housing market dynamics for informed decision-making by stakeholders in the real estate sector.

## Usage

There are three notebooks in this project. The first notebook, Divyesh_Lagisetty_code0.ipynb, is used for preprocessing data and producing data without and with PCA for dimensionality reduction. The other two notebooks, Divyesh_Lagisetty_code1.ipynb and Divyesh_Lagisetty_code2.ipynb, are used for implementing different regression techniques on the preprocessed data. After hyperparameter tuning on test data, the results obtained by these methods were uploaded in .npy files.
